A great way to meet new friends who turn into family!
No experience needed and you can bring your own equiptment or it will be provided!
Come on out to our meetings and see what you think!
We would love to have new people all ages!

<ol>
<li>Great Coaches
<li>Fun games and practices
<li>Learn a lot and get a lot of experience
</ol>

<h2>Practices</h2>
Practices are after school everyday. Sometimes Practices may happen on a student holiday but only if there is a game the following day.
<br>

<h2>Playing time</h2>
Each player will get playing time in every game throughout the season! You can get a Varsity letter by attending almost all practices
and playing in at least 3 games.
