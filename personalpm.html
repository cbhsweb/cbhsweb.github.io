In the early parts of the 20th century, Real Madrid first played at Campo De ODonnell, and then moved to the larger Campo de Chamartin in 1924.
In 1943, Chamartin had already become too small again, and club-president Santiago Bernabeu decided that Madrid needed a new and modern 100,000-stadium.
This new stadium got built at the same site of Campo de Chamartin. Construction began in 1945, and on the 14th of December 1947 Estadio Santiago Bernabeu officially opened with a match against Portuguese champions OS Belenenses (3-1).
The stadium was initially still called Nuevo Estadio Chamartin, but received the name of the club-president eight years later.
At that time, Estadio Santiago Bernabéu consisted of two uncovered tiers that could hold just over 75,000 spectators. Capacity was further increased to 125,000 in 1954, when one of the long sides got expanded with a third tier.
