<h2>Lakers History</h2>

<img src=history.jpg width=400>

<p>
The franchise that would become the Lakers was founded <br>in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National <br>Basketball League (NBL). The team moved to Minneapolis,<br>Minnesota, in 1947, and its name was changed to the Lakers<br>to reflect the Minnesota state nickname, “Land of 10,000 Lakes.”<br>That same year the Lakers acquired George Mikan, who became<br>professional basketball’s first dominant “big man” and the<br>first in a series of great Laker centres. The Lakers joined the <br>BAA (the official precursor of the NBA) for the 1948–49 season<br>and won the final BAA championship. The NBA was formed in <br>1949, and Mikan and the Lakers—which also featured future <br>Hall of Famers Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, Vern Mikkelsen, and <br>(from 1953) Clyde Lovellette—won four of the first five league <br>titles, establishing professional basketball’s first dynasty.
