	<h2>About Pink Robotics</h2>
	<p>
	    Pink Robotics is a FIRST robotics team which spans 5 different schools in Brevard
	    County, Florida. The team includes members from Cocoa Beach Jr./Sr. High School, 
	    Viera High School, Rockledge High School, Space Coast High School, and Satelite 
	    High School. The team also has many mentors from varying profesasions including NASA
	    engineers as well as engineers for SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, and other private
	    engineering organizations.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The goal of Pink Roboitics is to spread the ideas of STEM subjects and to introduce
	    students to the engineering design process as well as allow them to gain experience
	    from professionals in engineering fields. However, Pink Robotics also seeks to make
	    this fun for students by competing against other schools and working together to
	    achieve a goal which would be near impossible by themselves.
