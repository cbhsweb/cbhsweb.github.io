   Theatre is a moving art, such as acting or drama, something that you would see in the theatre.
While theatre is such a huge part of our society, so if film which is another type of acting completely. Meisner is all about powerful connections and noticing even the smallest of movements we make when acting.And improv is all about acting on the spot. Acting is a universal term but really they're are many different types of acting in our world.
<br>
    Acting, the performing art in which movement, gesture, and intonation are used to realize a fictional character for the stage, for motion pictures, or for television. Acting is generally agreed to be a matter less of mimicry, exhibitionism, or imitation than of the ability to react to imaginary stimuli.
<br>
  "The art of improv is creating something brilliant, funny and honest from nothing," said Curt Doussett, owner of Provo's Comedy Sportz improv venue. Started 15 years ago by his wife, Tonia, Provo’s Comedy Sportz is one of 34 franchises across the nation and is often ranked in the top three nationwide, according to Doussett.
<br>
   The 1st lesson of the Meisner Technique begins with communication. It is introduced through the repetition exercise, and its importance never goes away. All the lessons which follow — the activity work, emotional preparation, objectives, relationship, the dramatic imagination — continue to emphasize the communication between the actors, or what Sanford Meisner called the ‘contact work’. The life-blood of good acting is the interaction between the actors. It is the foundation. If we do not feel that the actors are in contact with each other, if we feel that they are talking ‘at’ each other instead of ‘to’ or ‘with’ each other, if we feel a disconnect between them, then their performance is not effective.

At the meetings we also play some games that help build your acting skills. Everyone is welcome to join at any time. The theatre club is run by Mr. Buck who also teaches the theatre class and film class here at our school. The seniors of the theatre troupe are the club presidents so if you have any questions you will usually be directed to one of them.
