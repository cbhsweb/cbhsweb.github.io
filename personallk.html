from 7th to 12th graders.Team work helps keep the team strong
and victoriuous throughout the season.This sport forces
one to use allof the muscles in the body. It takes hours of practice 
and there is always room for improvement.Swimming takes
a lot of endurance along with speed. Everyone on the team shows 
Beach Pride as they race across the pool or continuously cheer everyone else on.

Coach Hoyt 
<br>
Coach Sterman
<br>
<p>
In 2015, both Coaches joined the Cocoa Beach swim team.
Both coaches work very hard with the swimmers. 
They always try to push us to always do our best.They are always up to new challenges and 
want us to get out of our comfort zones, allowing us to face new challenges as well. Thye 
love working with the team and having fun at the same time. The two drive us to always work
hard to achieve our personal bests. To them winning is very important but, not as important 
as getting your own personal best. They work day in and day out deciding on what needs to be done. 
Showing how dedicated they our to our team.  Even though they may look or seem tough and/or mean,
they are always there to help.

<h2>Meets</h2>

<p>
During season, meets occur every thursday. At 
the beginning of the seaso there is one relay
meet which consists of just relays. The rest are all duel meets.
The location depends on the season. It will 
take place at either of the two schools participating. Based off of 
personal experience, a majority occurs at our home pool. Meets at home start
at around 4:00 and usually last until 6:00. It depends on how everything goes.
Away meets vary. Usually they start later, around 4:30 and last until around 7:00.

These events are very important for 
every serious swimmer. CCC is the most popular event,
because of the large amount of swimmers who can participate. 
It is an all day event that allows everyone a chance to compete in
a very serious atmosphere. Many goals and personal bests are completed during
