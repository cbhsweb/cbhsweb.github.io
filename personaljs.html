World Environment Day occurs on June 5th every year, and is the United Nation's 
principal vehicle for encouraging worldwide awareness and action for the protection of 
our environment. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness
 on emerging environmental issues from marine pollution, human overpopulation, and global 
warming, to sustainable consumption and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global 
platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. 
Each year, has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities,
 governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

The tiny state of Sikkim nestled in the Himalayas in northeastern India has been leading a green revolution of
 its own kind. Despite being small and isolated, and with its people leading their lives in extremely tough mountainous terrain,
 Sikkim has emerged as one of India’s environmental leaders. 
Sikkim, which in 1998 became the first Indian state to ban disposable plastic bags, is also among the
 first to target single-use plastic bottles. In 2016, Sikkim took two major decisions. It banned the use of packaged drinking water 
in government offices
 and government events. Second, it banned the use of Styrofoam and thermocol disposable plates and cutlery in the entire state in a move to cut down toxic plastic 
pollution and tackle its ever-increasing garbage problem.
