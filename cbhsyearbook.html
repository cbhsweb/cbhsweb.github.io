"There's no school year like your school year. Your yearbook celebrates a year 
full of friends, events and shared experiences. It's a place where your friends 
can jot down shared memories, too. Purchase one today; have memories on hand for a 
lifetime."  <b><i>- Jostens Yearbook Website </b></i></p>

<td align="center"><i>The yearbook staff has 
a few cameras that they can rent from the class 
room and take photos with. They can also use personal 
cameras. Photos need to be taken all over the school 
and should include as many people as possible.</td>
<td align="center"><i>Photographer + all staff</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center"><i>Caption Writing</td>
<td align="center"><i>Captions should be written to 
give in depth details of what it happening in the photo.
Captions should always start with a verb and never simply 
state the obvious. If it is a sports photo, for example, 
you should include what was taking place, where it was, 
who is involved, and the statistics of what happened.</td>
<td align="center"><i>All staff</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center"><i>Template Designing</td>
<td align="center"><i>Template designing is the 
first thing done when creating the yearbook. 
The templates are made over the summer in preparation 
for the year. The templates must be consistant 
and match the theme, color scheme of the book, 
and be well organized.</td>
<td align="center"><i>Editors</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center"><i>Interviews</td>
<td align="center"><i>Interviews typically take 
place after a photo is taken. Questions are asked 
to learn more about the scenario of the photo. 
It is good to get detailed background information. 
It will come in handy when writing the photo caption.</td>

<p>
Throughout the year, the yearbook staff has multiple deadlines to meet. 
By these designated deadlines, staff members must complete their assigned 
pages and turn them in. The deadlines this year were challenging to meet 
due to the small number of people on staff. Some of the deadlines this 
year were only 2-3 weeks apart. For these deadlines, the yearbook staff 
had to take photos, write captions, interview students, and conduct polls. 
With the help of their teacher, Mr. Walters, they were able to meet these 
deadlines on time.
</p>

<p>
The hardest aspect to meeting the deadlines was finding what pages could 
be completed. Many deadlines were assigned for the first semester. A majority 
of pages in the yearbook are sports pages. More than half of sports take place 
in the spring season, so those pages cannot be completed in the first semester.
