FBLA is a school "club" where members enter competitions against others in their area and if good enough, 
nationally. some of the competitions include manuscripts, business letters, business math, and PowerPoint projects done in small groups. 
They also do fundraisers and have meetings with others in their district to elect officers.
</br>


<br>
FBLA stands for the Future Business Leaders of America. The full name is FBLA-PBL. 
PBL stands for Phi-Beta Lambda, which is the college version of FBLA. What is FBLA? 
FBLA is a non-profit organization that prepares students for a future in the world of business. 
FBLA is for students grades 7-12, and there are also middle-level and college chapters.
</br>

<br>
At the State Leadership Conferences, students compete in events testing their business knowledge and skills. 
Top state winners are then eligible to compete for national awards at the National Leadership Conference each summer. 
States may modify the events offered at the district/region and state level. Always check 
your state guidelines if competing at the district/region and/or state level competition.

<br>
We have 20 members and meetings are every 1st and 3rd Thursday of every month at 8 AM
