The Paper Kites
</h1>
The Paper Kites is an Australian folk-rock group. The band was initially formed around duo Sam Bently and Christina Lacy, who've been performing together since highschool. 
Members Sam Rasmussen and Josh Bentley were recruited from other bands in 2010.
<br><br>
<b>Woodland:</b>The Paper Kites went on to begin writing and recording what would be their first EP, Woodland. They recorded the EP early in 2011 with Tim Johnston, who was one of Rasmussen's
university teachers. Their first official single, "Featherstone", was released in June 2011 in advance of the EP. The new single was again well received by audiences, especially online. 
Following the single release, the band also released their second video, for "Featherstone". Already having a passion for film, Bentley said, "We always like to get really involved in the
videos we make and the people we work with. Our music videos are just further extensions of the song itself, and we always want them to be interesting and engaging. We work pretty closely
with our directors." Sam Bentley commented that he felt very lucky for the amount of success Bloom and "Featherstone" gained online. That August their EP Woodland was released.
<br><br>
<b>Young North:</b>In April 2012, the band had over 30 unrecorded demos and were ready to start recording a full-length record. However, they decided to hold off making a full-length album and
release a second EP instead, feeling that more touring and building on their sound would be beneficial before releasing their debut record. They decided to work with engineer and producer Wayne
Connolly, and recorded the five-track EP through June 2012. It was the band's first time working with a producer. Bentley recalled, "Working with Wayne (Connolly) was very different to how we imagined
working with a producer would be. He was very patient while at the same time pushed the best performance out of us. He really got inside the songs and knew how to push our sonic ideas". The title of the
EP, Young North, came from the titles of two songs that did not make the cut.
<br><br>
<b>States:</b>The Paper Kites began recording their debut full-length album States in February 2013, collaborating once again with producer Wayne Connolly. The album was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in
Melbourne, and Alberts Studios in Sydney. The 13-track record was cut down from over 40 un-recorded demos, however the majority of material used was written in a two-week period prior to the band beginning
pre-production on the record.
<br><br>
<b>Twelvefour:</b>The band released their second album twelvefour on 28 August 2015. The album was recorded in Seattle and produced by Grammy-nominated music producer Phil Ek. The sessions took place across two
studiosâ€”the Avast Recording Company and Chris Walla's studio Hall of Justice. The record is a concept album written entirely between the hours of midnight and four am. The first single, "Electric Indigo", was released
in June with a music video following starring actress Laura Brent and Charles Grounds. "Revelator Eyes", "Renegade" and "Too Late" followed as singles.
<br><br>
<b>On the Train Ride Home:</b>On 18 April 2018, the band released the first of two new albums, On the Train Ride Home, consisting of eight tracks. Their follow-up album, On the Corner Where You Live is due to be released
in August 2018.
