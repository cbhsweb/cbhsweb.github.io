	<h4>
	    SGA is a leadership group focused on making connections with each other, the community, and other SGA's across the state. Our SGA district is 3,    	    which includes almost all of central Florida, there are 6 districts in Florida. Throughout the year, there are district meetings at a choosen highschool somewhere in the 
	    appropriate district. Once a year, there is a state conference held at a choosen school in any of the districts; last year, it was held at a school in Pensicola (in District 1), 
	    and next year, it will be help in Boca Raton (in District 5).
		<br>
		<br>
	    SGA is a common club found at almost every high school across the country. SGA's main responsibility is putting on the annual dance, Homecoming. 
	    Each class has four offices: President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary. On top of these offices there is an Executive Board consisting of: President, Vice
	    President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Historian. This past year, SGA's middle school chapter was finally established offically, the middle school's main responsibility 
	    is the middle school dance.

<h3>Homecoming-
</h3>
<h4> Homecoming is SGA's main project.Every year, SGA puts many hours into the Homecoming, the amount of work it takes to plan,
order, set up, and tear down is exhausting. Most of the fundraising throughout the year goes to homecoming.
We start planning in May for homecoming in October. SGA starts planing for homecoming by narrowing down the themes to choose from, 
and the following school year, those themes are then voted for on an online ballot. Then comes the ordering of food, drinks, decorations,
tickets, and renting Ferarris for the queen nominations and the class princesses. The Homecoming game is on the Friday before the dance. The next day,
Saturday, the dance is from 7pm-9pm. That morning, SGA members and officers set up for the dance. Then, later that day, the dance begins, the middle school chapter
of SGA serves food and beverages, and they also clean up, the middle schoolers clean up for our dance and the high schoolers clean up for the middle school dance.
