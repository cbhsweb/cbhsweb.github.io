<h3>
On a December day in 1977 in the Netherlands, a man was born which Basketball world was not ready for. Samuel Blake Hinkie is that man. He moved to Easly, South Carolina when he was 3 years old with his mother and father, Ron and Sarita Hinkie, and his two older siblings. At age 10 the family moved again to Marlow, Oklahoma. Shortly after, his older brother Bill passed away. Sam graduated in 1996 at Marlow High School as valedictorian. He played basketball and football as point guard and a defensive back.

<h3>
Following his graduation from Stanford he took a full-time job with the Houston Rockets to be Special Assistant to then Rockets GM Carroll Dawson. In 2007 he was promoted to Vice President, becoming the youngest VP in the NBA. That same year, current Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey was hired to be the new GM for the Rockets(he has made notable trades such as the trade for James Harden in 2008 and the trade for Chris Paul in summer 2017). In 2010 Hinkie was promoted once more to Executive VP. During his time as second-in-command to Daryl Morey, he promoted the use of advanced statistics in basketball. Darly Morey promoted that with him as well. While in Houston, Hinkie played an important role in acquiring future point guards Kyle Lowry and Patrick Beverly.

<h3>
At the end of the 2012-2013 season the Philadelphia 76ers hired Hinkie as their new GM, their third since 2011. His first major move as GM was trading then All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for a top-5 protected draft pick and just drafted Nerlens Noel. In this draft he also selected that draft class' Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams. In August 2013, Hinkie hired Brett Brown to be the new coach. During the 2013-2014 season, Hinkie was accused of promoting the 76ers to "tank" (losing on purpose in order to accumulate high draft picks) due to the 76ers tying the NBA record for longest losing streak at that time. At the trade deadline of the 2013-2014 season, Hinkie traded veteran players Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, and Lavoy Allen getting in return for it five second round picks and Henry Sims. At the end of the season Hinkie traded Thaddeus Young to the Minnesota Timberwolves for a top-10 protected, first round pick from the Miami Heat, Luc Mbah a Moute, and 
Alexy Shved.

<h3>
In the 2014 draft, Hinkie drafted Joel Embiid with the 3rd overall pick. Hinkie believed in the potential of Embiid, drafting in-spite of his injuries. Embiid would not play his first NBA game until the 2016-2017 season, 2 years after being drafted. With this pick, The Process officially began. The Process is Sam Hinkies way of molding a championship roster for the 76ers by aquiring draft picks and veteran players through trades, picking the best player available in the draft no matter the postion he plays, and tanking in order to to have a better statistical chance of getting a high draft pick until the roster is ready to comepete for a championship. The Process will be completed by winning an NBA championsip. In the 2014 draft, he also drafted an overseas player, Dario Saric (who many said would never come over to play in the NBA but he did come over during the 2016-2017 season and is now a key piece in the 76ers roster) after making a trade to the Magic giving them Elfrid Payton. During the 2014-2015 season, Hinkie also signed NBA D-League player Robert Covington (who is now one of the best 3 point shooters and defensive players in the NBA), to a 4 year deal. During the trade deadline, Hinkie traded Michael-Carter Williams and Nerlons Noel (who he drafted 2 years before that point) for Javale McGee, Isaiah Canaan and two 2015 first round picks owned originally by the Lakers and Thunder and a second round pick. At the end of the 2014-2015 season the Sixers ended with a 18-64 record (third worst in the league) and got the 3rd pick in the 2015 draft. In the 2015 draft Hinkie drafted Jahlil Okafor with that 3rd pick and drafted Richaun Holmes and J.P. Tokoto in the second round. After the draft in the 2015 offseason Hinkie knew that his time in Philidelphia was getting shorter by the day as owners and fans began to crucify him for making the Sixers tank. The owners and fans were tired of losing and not seeing results. Hinkie knew he would be fired from his job as GM. For this he planted more seeds in The Process, trading  two second round picks for Nik Stauskas, Jason Thompson, Carl Landry, a 2019 first round pick, and the right to swap first round picks with Sacramento in 2016 and 2017.

<h3>
On April 6, 2016, Sam Hinkie stepped down as GM of the Philadelphia 76ers. He was not fired, but with the high tensions in the front office he decided to step down. But, the fruits of the Process still live on. The things that would come the following season can be shown throught this Game of Zones episode by Bleacher Report. This also shows the fan reaction towards the firing of Hinkie and the emotion behind it.

The Seeds of the Process Have Sprout
</h1>
 <img src=ganggang.jpg width=400 height=200>
<h3>
After missing the playoffs in the 2017 season, a (mostly) healthy Sixers team obtained a 52-30 record and the Third seed in the East. Ben Simmons had an All-Time great rookie season and Joel Embiid stayed healthy for the majority of the year and was voted as an All-Star starter, in only his second season. Veterans such as J.J Redick and Amir Johnson, out-standing role players like Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Ersan Illyasova, Marco Bellineli, and up-and coming young talents such as Richaun Holmes and Dario Saric, really the whole team was a huge part of making a Sixers playoff berth possible. Although Markelle Fultz has been injured for the majority of the season, he came back in the final strech of the season and proved as a vital asset in getting the Third seed. He has not played a lot in the playoffs this year. Speaking of playoffs, last night (April 24, 2018) the Sixers won their first playoff series since 2012 against the Miami Heat, winning the series 4-1, and now have the best odds of making the Finals in the East according to Vegas. The website will continue to be updated as the playoffs get deeper.

In conclusion, Sam Hinkie turned a dying franchise into a future dynasty. He deserves all of our respect and he did indeed die for the sins of the 76ers organization. The success of the 76ers can all be creditied to one man who had a dream, and through that dream, the Process was made, and through the seeds he planted, the Process will be completed.
