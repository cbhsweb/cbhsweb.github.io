<h3><u>About FPS</u></h3>
<p>FPS is a dynamic international program involving thousands of students annually from around the world. Developed in 1974 by creativity
pioneer Dr. E. Paul Torrance, Future Problem Solving (FPS) 
provides competitive and non-competitive components for today’s curriculum via a six-step model which teaches critical and creative thinking, 
problem solving, and decision making.</p>

<a name=#howitworks><h2>How it works:</h2>
<p> In the main competitions, teams of four students work in a two hour time period to complete a six step booklet.
These steps are influenced by the scenario provided to students at the beginning of the alloted time. 
These scenarios are based on problems that may be seen in the future such as natural disasters, cloud storage issues,
and epidemics.
</p>
<br>
</center>
These steps are as follows:
<ol>
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Determine 16 Problems from the Scenario
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Determine the Underlying Problem (UP) of all Sixteen
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Find 15 Solutions for the UP
<li><b>Step 4:</b> Create Criteria to Judge the Solutions
<li><b>Step 5:</b> Rate the Solutions Against Criteria and Determine Best Solution
<li><b>Step 6:</b> Describe and Action Plan Based on Best Solution to Solve UP
</ol><center>
There is a district, state, and national competition. If your team places top 3 in Districts, they move on to States. 
If they place in the top 2, they are invited to the national competition.

<a name=#whosinvolved><h2>Who's involved:</h2>
<p> There are several levels at which you can compete in a booklet or scenario competition.
The first is  unior: students from grades 5 and 6. Next is middle: students from grades 7 and
8. Finally, there is senior: grades 10 through 12. 
Cocoa Beach had two senior teams and two middle teams. (2018) The club is sponsored worldwide and can be found in many
elementary and high schools. After four years experience, students have the opportunity to become evaluators: people who score the booklets.
Coaches train their students in the six-step process and work to help them find teams they are likely to succeed in.

<img src=GetStarted.jpg height=160 width=200>
<p>Talk to your principal to find out if your school has an FPS club. If they do, find the coach. Cocoa Beach's club is run by
Mrs. Walker and Dr. Baldridge. Sign up at the beginning of the year and encourage friends to join the club and learn the 
process with you. You can find you team and begin practicing completing the booklet. You will have several practice booklet 
before the competition order to prepare for Districts in February.

Different Competitions:
</h2>
<p>There are five types of competitions students can compete in:</p>
</center>
<table border=5 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
	<th><b>Community Problem Solving (CmPS):</b></th>
	<th><b>Global Issues (GIP):</b></th>
	<th><b>Presentation of Action Plan (PAP):</b></th>
	<th><b>Scenario Performance (ScP):</b></th>
	<th><b>Scenario Writing (SW):</b></th>
<tr><td> Students involved in Community Problem Solving (CmPS) learn powerful lessons about creating change, about dealing with 
local authorities and organizations, and about making a positive impact. The top Community Problem Solving projects are invited to the FPSP International Conference in June.
</td>
<td> Students vote to determine the five annual topics from three strands – Science/Technology, Business/Economics, and Social/Political. Recent topics 
include issues such as ocean soup, land transportation, mega cities, enhancing human potential, and processed foods.
</td>
<td> In Scenario Performance, students choose the FPS annual topic that interests them as they project twenty years into the future and create a 
futuristic story. This story is not written out in full; it is "told" and should be more "natural" and "spontaneous" in nature.
</td>
<td> Scenario Writing is an individual competition in which students develop short stories related to one of five FPS topics for the year. The story
(1500 words or less) is set at least 20 years in the future and is an imagined, but logical, outcome of actions or events taking place in the world.
