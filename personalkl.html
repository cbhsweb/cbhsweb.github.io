<p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly known as Real Madrid, or simply as Real, 
is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. Founded on 6 March 1902 
as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since 
inception. The word Real is Spanish for Royal and was bestowed to the club by 
King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team 
has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in 
downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's 
members have owned and operated the club throughout its history.
</p>

<p>The club was estimated to be worth €3.24 billion ($3.65 billion) in 2015, and 
in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the 
world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million. The club is one of the most 
widely supported teams in the world. Real Madrid is one of three founding members 
of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic 
Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably 
El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi with Atlético Madrid.
