					<td>Morty Smith</td>
					<td>Justin Roiland</td>
					<td>Rick's 14-year-old grandson who is frequently dragged into Rick's misadventures. Morty is a good kid but he is easily distressed. He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans, and he often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox methods Rick uses to 'fix' situations.</td>

					<td>Beth Smith</td>
					<td>Sarah Chalke</td>
					<td>Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother, and Jerry's wife. She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared to human medicine.</td>

					<td>Jerry Smith</td>
					<td>Chris Parnell</td>
					<td>Summer and Morty's insecure father, Beth's husband, and Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Generally insecure, he is frequently led into conflicts stemming from opportunistic posturing, while his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with Rick.</td>
